<div id="intro">

<p>I learned of Fresh Tilled Soil online. I am a college graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering, and I have also done some studies in information technology. I am transitioning into a career in user experience and web design, and I believe that participating in Fresh Tilled Soil's AUX program would accelerate that transition and help me develop into a highly skilled designer.</p>

<p>I am a perfect fit for the AUX program because I have a background that will help me get a lot out of the program, which I believe will expose me to an area of web site design that will give me versatility as a designer.</p>

<h3>Technical Background</h3>
<p>With my technical background, web design has been a great field for me to transition into because it requires abilities that I have already developed as an engineering major.</p>
<ul>
<li>Planning, designing, and implementing systems to meet objectives</li>
<li>Collecting, organizing, and analyzing data in collaboration with others to deliver solutions to problems</li>
<li>Testing and revising project iterations with thoroughness, attention to detail, and efficiency</li>
</ul>

<h3>Relevant Experience</h3>
<p>My work experience as a web development
intern has given me a foundational introduction to web design and development. At this internship, I have learned about the basic details, large and small, of creating web sites. I have become familiar with content management systems, website hosting, and HTML/CSS coding techniques. I have also gained experience working with Basecamp for project management.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install WordPress onto client sites, along with plugins and design templates via WordPress interface and FTP access into site files</li>
<li>Set up menu and page layouts for sites according to wireframe documents</li>
<li>Load and style content on site pages via WordPress editor, template/plugin short codes, and CSS/PHP files</li>
<li>QA testing of websites to ensure layout is correct and element functions work properly</li>


</ul>

<h3>Design & Development Skills</h3>
<p>Independent studying and front end development coursework have also broadened my web development capabilities and taught me to create and manipulate dynamic web sites. I have working knowledge of and some experience with a few languages and tools.</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML and CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript and jQuery</li>
<li>PHP, MySQL, and C++</li>
<li>Adobe InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, after college, I gained tremendous experience in business and customer service that can help me as a designer and an apprentice. I have experience in conducting database searches, compiling and analyzing results, and drafting conclusions in formal reports for submission to business associates and customers. My experience in customer service has also provided me with training and communicating with customers over the telephone, gathering information from clients, and developing new business goals based on customer feedback. My experience has also helped me strengthen my performance in prioritization and time management of tasks, serving clients’ needs, and building professional relationships.</p>

<p>By drawing from my talents and experiences, I believe that I can contribute greatly to Fresh Tilled Soil’s efforts of providing quality service to its clients while gaining invaluable experience. An opportunity to further discuss how my skills and experience would be of value to Fresh Tilled Soil would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your consideration.  </p>
